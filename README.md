GIVE ME A DAY OR TWO TO WRITE UP A DESCRIPTION OF THE DOCS ... TERRY TAYLOR (22 MAY 2019)

These are a few of the docs I have written over the years.  These docs are not confidential. The target audience was technical and the focus was on useful, accurate content with a minimum of text and diagrams.

AD (Automation Designer) 

The product
AD was a PLM product that basically connected NX, EPLAN (electrical schematics) and TIA (PLC programming).

The task
I was to write installation guides and user guides for AD. 

The challenges
1. As a contractor, I could not use client computers, access the client internal network, or sit near client employees. I was supposed to access the product via a very slow remote connection. From a practical perspective, this made the job impossible.
2. The client tech writers had little interest in how AD actually worked. The existing user guide was just a rehashed version of a software spec. The client tech writers were in the office only one day a week. 
3. The program and product managers were at a different location. I was supposed to work with developers who had little understanding of the big picture or how to create end user applications.
4. The Siemens documentation system (similar to Schema ST4) was great for managing large numbers of huge documents, but was not easy to use.

My activities
1. After several months I got permission to use a client computer, the internal network, and sit beside the developers (as long as I kept a low profile).
2. I installed (with a lot of assistance) AD, EPLAN and TIA on my own PC. I spent months learning how to use them and how to use AD to link them together. I also did a lot of hands on examples. I had very little assistance.
3. I created internal documents using MS Word that described very accurately and in detail how to get started with AD. The AD_GS_partial.pdf shown in this portfolio is a "distilled" version created with the client's doc system. Note that this system limited my abilities to create diagrams and control formatting.

The results
The docs I created provide a lot of very useful info. Not only concepts, but critical details that you could only appreciate when actually trying to use a complex system like AD that was still under development. For example, in one dialog, if you left a space after an entry, the system would crash and your project that took 3-4 hours to build would be lost. 

Why I left
The client office was in a beautiful building on the banks of the Rhein river, and I lived 5 minutes by bike in a converted monastery. The office atmosphere was very socialable and friendly. It was one of the most pleasant places I have ever worked. And my employer Goetz und Weise was the best.  But AD was still in development and was quite a challenge to use. It would be years before the product would be ready for beta release. I asked many times to move to the office where the program/product managers were located, but this was not going to happen. There were several new writers who took the traditional approach to documenting such a system (lots of text and no examples), and it seemed that the client was quite satisfied with that approach. It was time to move on.
