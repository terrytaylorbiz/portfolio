# Portfolio description

These are a few of the docs I have written over the years. The target audience was technical and the focus was on useful, accurate content with a minimum of text and diagrams.


### 11_AD_GS_partial.pdf (half of the doc deleted to make it smaller) 

The product --- AD (Automation Designer) was a PLM product that basically connected NX, EPLAN (electrical schematics) and TIA (PLC programming).

The task --- I was to write installation guides and user guides for AD. 

The challenges ---
1. As a contractor, I could not use client computers, access the client internal network, or sit near client employees. I was supposed to access the product via a very slow remote connection. From a practical perspective, this made the job impossible.
2. The client tech writers had little interest in how AD actually worked. The existing user guide was just a rehashed version of a software spec. The client tech writers were in the office only one day a week. 
3. The program and product managers were at a different location. I was supposed to work with developers who had little understanding of the big picture or how to create end user applications.
4. The Siemens documentation system (similar to Schema ST4) was great for managing large numbers of huge documents, but was not easy to use.

My activities ---
1. After several months I got permission to use a client computer, the internal network, and sit beside the developers (as long as I kept a low profile).
2. I installed (with a lot of assistance) AD, EPLAN and TIA on my own PC. I spent months learning how to use them and how to use AD to link them together. I also did a lot of hands on examples ï¼ˆI had very little assistance with these example apps).
3. I created internal MS Word docs that described very accurately and in great detail how to get started with AD. The AD_GS_partial.pdf shown in this portfolio is a "distilled" version created with the client's doc system (I have an internal version with a lot of extra details that I could show in person). Note that this doc system limited my abilities to create diagrams and control formatting.

The results --- The docs I created provide a lot of very useful info. Not only concepts, but critical details that you could only appreciate when actually trying to use a complex system like AD that was still under development. For example, in one dialog, if you left a space after an entry, the system would crash and your project that took 3-4 hours to build would be lost. 

Why I left --- The client office was in a beautiful building on the banks of the Rhein river, and I lived 5 minutes by bike in a converted abbey. The office atmosphere was very socialable and friendly. It was one of the most pleasant places I have ever worked. And my employer Goetz und Weise was the best.  But AD was still in development and was quite a challenge to use. It would be years before the product was ready for beta release. I asked many times to move to the office where the program/product managers were located, but this was not going to happen. There were several new writers who took the traditional approach to documenting such a system (lots of text and no examples), and it seemed that the client was quite satisfied with that approach. It was time to move on. One thing is for sure, any new writer who wanted to learn how AD actually worked would have saved months of effort by reading the docs I wrote.
   
     
### 21_FGX_UG.pdf

** Please note: 21_FGX_UG.pdf was created from single-source source files. We created almost 15 different versions of this doc just for the English version (we also had Japanese and Chinese versions). Therefore there may be some diagrams or text with small formatting or alignment problems. Also, all diagrams and screenshots were modified to minimize the resulting PDF file size (the resulting PDF file size is rather small for such a large doc with so many diagrams). The priority was creating a lot of info with limited resources for very technical readers. We accomplished that.

The product --- The product was a firewall/router that was sold under several brand names. The documentation was released in English, Japanese and Chinese.

The task --- I was the documentation manager for a group of seven. 

The challenges ---
1. The existing docs had a great deal of text but provided little useful info.  
2. The doc and help sources were separate files. The files were scattered throughout the file system. There were many copies and no version tracking.
3. The program/product managers were located in a different city.
4. The working atmosphere within the team was rather unpleasant.

My activities ---
1. I created a very friendly American-style work atmosphere. The doc manager that I replaced was not the most effective manager or pleasant person to work with (the other colleagues were afraid of him). He resigned a few months after my arrival.
2. I deleted 40% of the existing user guide. The deleted text was useless text used to fill up the doc to give the impression that the writers were productive. They had plagiarized text from textbooks and other sources (I could tell from the perfect English). I cleaned up and reorganized the remaining text, added all the screenshots and diagrams, and then added most of the existing text (the team members were primarily busy maintaining the Chinese and Japanese versions of the doc).
3. I totally reorganized the existing user guide, deleted almost half the content, and then worked with the team to double the size of the doc (with useful content). Most of the examples and screenshots are from my PC. I installed the router-firewall in a VM on my laptop and started hands-on self study. I had limited experience with industrial grade router-firewalls. I spent a lot of time studying competitors' products and documentation (Juniper, etc.) and reading RFC's.
4. I drastically increased team productivity. I simplified my colleagues' work by converting the existing documentation to single-source. Originally the PDF sources were Framemaker and the HELP sources were MS Word. There was a separate set of .fm/.doc files for different customer versions (the example you can download is branded for FGX, an Asian customer). I configured the FM files (using imported formats and variables) to create the required PDF, HELP, and customer versions from a single set of source files. This worked flawlessly (I still have the source files).

The results ---
1. The team spent most of their time creating original content (creating the single-source content was easy).
2. Several team members could manage the Framemaker single-source projects. There were very few problems (it was a clean design). 

Why I left --- It was a great experience. In particular my Chinese manager and the team were very friendly and helpful. But I left because of the following reasons.
1. After a year and half, one of the project/product managers from Beijing actually came by to talk to me. I was so 
happy that I might finally be included in their team discussions. He just wanted to ask me if I could teach his kid English.
2. The company would not confirm if they would offer me a new contract until two months before my existing contract expired. My visa to stay in China was with this company, so if they did not offer a new contract, I probably would have had to return to the USA to get a new visa.
3. We had a small earthquake. Such an event made me think twice about spending so much time in a very large office building of obviously low construction quality.

As with every job experience in China I put together a few more pieces of the puzzle that is China. 
   
   
### 31_cit_doc_processes.pdf, 32/33_scqc_install_config_RELEASE/TRAINING.pdf         

The task --- At HP Shanghai one of my tasks was to document a "synchronizer". The synchronizer was a program that would synchronize  database updates in systems A and B. My task was to document in detail how to configure a synchronizer between Service Center (SC) and Quality Center  (QC). 

My activities --- I found a developer who helped me setup SC, QC, and the synchronizer in a VM on my own laptop. I then created  an example synchronization configurations and documented in detail. I tagged Framemaker text so that I could create a release and internal version of the document from the same source files. 

The results --- The release version is 02_scqc_install_config_RELEASE.pdf. I used the internal version 03_scqc_install_config_TRAINING.pdf to demonstrate synchronizer installation/configuration at HP. I installed all software on my PC and created the simple examples myself.

I also wrote 01_cit_doc_processes.pdf. I inherited a very complex doc project that was run on a VM in Paris, and converted to work on a local machine. This doc describes how to switch to a new doc system.

Why I left --- My first job in China was with a Taiwanese company and my second job was with HP. I had the idea that I could find more interesting work with a "real" Chinese company, not realizing that the Taiwanese company and HP were some of the best employers you could find in China. My mistake.


### 41_fw.pdf, 42_afw.pdf, 43_pfw.pdf, 44_obf.pdf, 45_fwj.pdf         

The product --- Mynd was developing frameworks for Java and Smalltalk.

The task --- My job was to write the original docs.

The challenges --- There were few challenges, except for learning the software. Mynd was probably the best company I ever worked for.

Why I left --- Mynd USA bought PMS Micado Germany which became Mynd Germany. Mynd's fortunes took a turn for the worse, the projects were drying up, so I moved on.
